# ISPICE
####Author - Nikhil Narayanan
I built a rudimentary version of the SPICE circuit simulator using my knowledge of circuit analysis as well as linear algebra.
It was an invaluable exercise in data structures and taught me a lot about writing clean, and mathematically sound code. I hope to build further optimizations on this simulator down the line, and I also hope to apply what I've learnt here to later build a genome sequencer after I've learnt a bit more about algorithms and bioinformatics.
